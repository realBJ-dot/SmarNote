**"Birthday party"** might suggest:

- cake, candles, balloons, gifts, party hats (local)

## Privacy & Security

### Local AI

- All processing happens on your device
- No data is transmitted anywhere
- Completely private and secure

### Cloud AI

- Only event titles and dates are sent to Groq
- API key is stored securely in your device's keychain
- No personal information or other app data is shared
- You can remove the API key anytime

## Cost Considerations

### Local AI

- Completely free
- No ongoing costs

### Cloud AI

- Uses Groq's API (pay-per-use)
- Typical cost: ~$0.001-0.002 per suggestion
- Most users spend less than $1/month
- You control usage by enabling/disabling the API key

## Troubleshooting

### No Suggestions Appearing

1. Ensure event title is at least 3 characters
2. Check internet connection (for cloud suggestions)
3. Verify API key is correctly entered
4. Try a more descriptive event title

### Cloud Suggestions Not Working

1. Check AI Settings - should show "AI Features Enabled"
2. Verify API key starts with "gsk\_"
3. Ensure you have Groq API credits
4. Local suggestions should still work

### Performance Issues

1. Cloud suggestions may take 1-2 seconds - this is normal
2. Local suggestions are always instant
3. Suggestions are cached briefly to improve performance
