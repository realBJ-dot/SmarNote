# App Store Security Checklist for SmarNote

## âœ… Completed Security Measures

### 1. Secret Management

- [x] Removed hardcoded API keys from source code
- [x] Implemented Keychain storage for production API keys
- [x] Added environment variable support for development
- [x] Created secure configuration system
- [x] Updated .gitignore to prevent future secret commits

### 2. Code Security

- [x] API keys stored in iOS Keychain (most secure option)
- [x] Development vs Production environment separation
- [x] Secure field input for API key entry

## ðŸ”„ Required Actions for App Store Submission

### 3. Privacy Policy Updates

You need to update your privacy policy to include:

```markdown
## Data Collection and Usage

### API Keys

- Your Groq API keys are stored locally on your device using iOS Keychain
- API keys are never transmitted to our servers
- Only you have access to your API keys

### AI Processing

- When using Cloud AI mode, only event titles are sent to Groq for processing
- No personal information, contacts, or sensitive data is transmitted
- All AI processing in Local mode happens entirely on your device

### Data Retention

- API keys remain on your device until you manually remove them
- No usage data is collected or stored by our servers
```

### 4. App Store Connect Configuration

#### App Information

- **Category**: Productivity
- **Content Rating**: 4+ (No objectionable content)

#### Privacy Details (Required)

You must declare in App Store Connect:

- **Data Not Collected**: Check this if you don't collect any user data
- **Third-Party APIs**: Mention Groq usage for AI features
- **Data Types**: None (since API keys stay local)

#### Export Compliance

- **Uses Encryption**: YES (because you use Keychain)
- **Encryption Type**: Standard iOS Keychain encryption
- **Export Compliance**: Usually exempt for standard iOS encryption

### 5. Code Signing & Certificates

- Ensure you have a valid Apple Developer Program membership
- Use Distribution certificate for App Store builds
- Enable App Store provisioning profile

### 6. Build Configuration

#### Release Build Settings

Add these to your Release configuration:

```swift
// In your build settings or Info.plist
SWIFT_ACTIVE_COMPILATION_CONDITIONS = RELEASE
```

#### Entitlements

Ensure your app has proper entitlements:

- Keychain Sharing (if needed)
- Network access for API calls

### 7. Testing Requirements

#### Security Testing

- [ ] Test API key storage/retrieval in production build
- [ ] Verify no secrets in compiled binary
- [ ] Test offline functionality (Local AI mode)
- [ ] Verify secure network connections (HTTPS only)

#### App Store Review Testing

- [ ] Test with fresh install (no existing data)
- [ ] Test API key input validation
- [ ] Test graceful handling of network failures
- [ ] Ensure app works without API key (Local mode)

### 8. Documentation for Review Team

Create a file for the review team explaining:

```
# For App Store Review Team

## API Key Usage
- Users must provide their own Groq API keys
- Keys are stored securely in iOS Keychain
- App functions fully without API keys (Local AI mode)
- No hardcoded secrets in the app

## Testing Instructions
1. App works immediately in "Local AI Only" mode
2. To test Cloud AI: Get free API key from console.groq.com
3. Enter key in Settings > AI Settings
4. Cloud features will activate

## Privacy
- No user data collected by our servers
- API keys never leave the user's device
- Only event titles sent to Groq when using Cloud AI
```

## ðŸš¨ Critical Security Reminders

### Before Each Release

1. **Audit for secrets**: Run `grep -r "gsk_" .` to ensure no API keys
2. **Check git history**: Ensure no secrets in commit history
3. **Test production build**: Verify Keychain storage works
4. **Review network calls**: Ensure all API calls use HTTPS

### Ongoing Security

1. **Monitor dependencies**: Keep third-party libraries updated
2. **Regular security audits**: Check for new vulnerabilities
3. **User education**: Provide clear instructions for API key security

## ðŸ“± User-Facing Security Features

### In-App Security Messaging

- Clear explanation of where API keys are stored
- Privacy-focused messaging about data usage
- Option to delete API keys easily
- Transparent about what data is sent to external services

### Settings UI Improvements

- Security indicators (lock icons, etc.)
- Clear privacy explanations
- Easy key management options
